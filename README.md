This application was created both as a way to hone and show off my skills, as well as to fill a craving. 

Instead of overflowing the user with the many todo's he or she has braindumped before, this app will attempt to offer only a few of the more urgent todo's from your backlog. Furthermore, it is also intended to be used for recurring todo's that can be snoozed or rescheduled at your whim.

The app is created using React and Typescript, combined with Bootstrap 4 and Feather-Icons for styling.
